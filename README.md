# shelltest

shelltest is a shell script testing engine

## Work In Progress
- [ ] Each test would be a bash function starting with `test_` (like gotest) for simplicity
- [ ] Test files would be simple shell script with additional setup and teardown mechanics
- [ ] Assertion Library (as who likes to write bash test conditions)
- [ ] Clean and Modern Test Execution Display
